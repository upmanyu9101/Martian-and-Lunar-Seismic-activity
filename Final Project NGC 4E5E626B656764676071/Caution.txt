*The original code uses a switch for only lunar and martian seismic data based on their planetary parameters listed out as the p and s wave velocities and their densities

The generality lies in the fact that the switch can be omitted and the parameters can be adjusted for theoretically any terrestrial object in terms of the p and s wave velocities and absolute densities.
