The current code is checking absolute equivalency between the values in the MSEED files and the CSV files. 

The code is configurable to check the values up to a certain threshold depending upon the accuracy needed for its application:

This can be configured by changing the following lines:

(current) line 33 - velocityTolerance = 0;
(modded) line 33 - velocityTolerance = n; where n can be whatever value required based on required degree of accuracy eg. (1e+-3)

(current) line 52 - if abs(mseedVelocity - csvVelocity) == velocityTolerance;
(modified) line 52 - if abs(mseedVelocity - csvVelocity) <= velocityTolerance;
