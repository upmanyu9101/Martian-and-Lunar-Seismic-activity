<h1>Martian and Lunar Seismic Activity - NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2024</h1>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>NASA SpaceApps Challenge 2024</strong> repository! This project is part of the Solar System Seismic Activity challenge, where we aim to analyze seismic events on both Mars and the Moon using real-world data. By studying marsquakes and moonquakes, we hope to uncover valuable information about the internal structures and geological processes of these celestial bodies.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Seismic activity is a powerful tool for planetary science, as it provides critical insights into the interior composition and geodynamics of planetary bodies. By analyzing seismic events, scientists can infer the composition, structure, and tectonic activity occurring beneath the surface. This project focuses on two key celestial bodies: <strong>Mars</strong> and the <strong>Moon</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mars</strong>: Seismic data from NASA's <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/">InSight</a> mission is used to investigate marsquakes. These seismic events help reveal the internal structure of Mars, including its core, mantle, and crust.</li>
  <li><strong>Moon</strong>: Lunar seismic data from the Apollo missions is analyzed to understand the seismic activity and tectonic history of the Moon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through this repository, we aim to develop tools and methods to process, analyze, and visualize seismic data from both Mars and the Moon, enhancing our understanding of their geophysics and geological history.</p>

<h3>Project Goals:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Seismic Data Analysis</strong>: Utilize seismic data from NASA's InSight mission on Mars and lunar seismic data from the Apollo and Chang’e 4 missions to study seismic events.</li>
  <li><strong>Classification of Seismic Events</strong>: Differentiate between various types of seismic activities (tectonic, volcanic, impact-based) on both Mars and the Moon.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-Reference with External Data</strong>: Use available datasets and cross-reference the seismic events with geological and environmental data for better context and accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mars and Moon Mode</strong>: Toggle between Mars and Moon seismic analysis using real-time data.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-Referencing Tools</strong>: Cross-reference seismic data against additional datasets like meteorological and surface data for more accurate classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Graphical Visualizations</strong>: Interactive plotting of seismic signals and their frequency analysis, enabling users to visualize seismic waveforms and frequencies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Seismic Data Sources:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mars</strong>: Data from NASA's <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/">InSight</a> mission, which includes recordings of marsquakes detected on the Martian surface.</li>
  <li><strong>Moon</strong>: Data from the <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1969-059A-04">Apollo Seismic Experiment</a> and China’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/china-s-chang-e-4-mission">Chang’e 4</a> mission, offering insight into the Moon’s seismic activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies and Tools:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MATLAB</strong>: For seismic signal processing and cross-referencing data with external sources.</li>
  <li><strong>MiniSEED Format</strong>: MiniSEED format for handling seismic waveform data.</li>
  <li><strong>CSV Data Cross-Referencing</strong>: Ability to cross-reference seismic events with CSV datasets containing metadata or auxiliary information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository.</li>
  <li>Install necessary dependencies.</li>
  <li>Load seismic data (in MiniSEED format) and run the analysis scripts.</li>
  <li>Toggle between Martian and Lunar seismic modes using keyboard inputs.</li>
</ol>
